Hello, my name is Brian Harris (he/him). I'm a second-year student at UC Berkeley studying planetary science and astrophysics!

I am especially interested in the study of planetary atmospheres, exoplanets, and stars. I have research experience in double star astrometry. 

Data visualization and the solving of physical problems using code are particular interests to me and I plan on fostering these skills in my studies, personal ventures, and work opportunities.

The best place to reach me is my email, bharris@berkeley.edu
